    <h3>MyTeleHealth App</h3>
      <p><!-- open paragraph -->
     Telemedicine is the use of digital information and communication for providing and receiving healthcare services remotely. Telemedicine has evolved to become a highly regarded practice. It's personal benefits for patient are found in its convenience, cost efficiency, privacy assurance, expedited transmission of lab results, and reduction of time in the waiting room (healthus.com). On a wider scale, telemedicine also has a huge impact. The practice makes healthcare more accessible to people who live in isolated communities, it makes patient services more readily available, it provide access to medical specialists, and it also improves communication and coordination of patient care between multiple doctors.
     </p>

     <p>In the midst of the COVID 19 pandemic, telemedicine became a huge focus for healthcare practitioners. In fact, it sparked a revolution. Providers and health based institutions have expanded their catalogues to include digital services. This was all done to keep patients out of hospitals and away from those who tested positive for the virus. The impact was more patients were recognizing their options when it comes to receiving healthcare, and making the choice on what is most beneficial to their lifestyle. However, the idea of remote healthcare is still new to a lot of potential users, which helped provide the basis for the problem statement:
    </p>

    <h4>How might we make telemedicine more convenient and accessible to anyone who could benefit from it?
    </h4>

    <p>The solution is to design an app that enables its users to receive telehealth appointments and access to healthcare resources at anytime and anywhere.  Book a telehealth appointment to speak to doctors, specialist and clinical professionals at a rate that is reasonable to users with and without insurance.
    </p>

    <p> The resulting health app MyTeleHealth is used to monitor individual progress and provide access medical professionals via telehealth appointments. The app also offers support by tracking a users prescriptions, labs and health records, and also providing community resources such as locating a local provider, specialist, clinic or a ride to appointments.  
    </p>

    <h3>Next Steps</h3>

    <p> While I only focused on the development of a few key feature for this project, I'd like to build out other key aspects such as a discussion board and forum function. I think users would find it helpful if there are any frequently asked questions about a certain disease or medical condition that are answered directly by medical professionals. I would like to conduct research if adding a discussion board would add value for users or if it would distract from the primary function of the app.</p>

    <p> I would also like the app to be expanded not only to patients but also fleshed out enough to be used by other health related agencies. This project was inspired by my current role as a healthcare administrator at a homecare agency, Genesis Total Healthcare LLC.  At GTH, patients are eligible for clinical services if they are homebound. However, In this role, I have seen many patients not be able to continue care because they were not able to see their doctor for a face to face visit. </p>

    <p> Therefore, I would like to expand this app to have a portal for clinicians who work at private agencies to monitor several patients at once. While the purpose of the app is still the same, the functionality has shifted slightly. How is the app made to accommodate another user added to the process? Do we pair with healthcare agencies to offer customer service, warranties, and updates? These are all questions that would need to be considered in order to go forward.</p>

    <h3>Outcomes and Lessons</h3>

    <p> I have formal training as a biomedical engineer and this is my second design project related to healthcare. I learned many lessons along the way. Some of the key takeaways include: </p>

    <h4> Function supersedes aesthetics:</h4>

    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic sparked a telehealth revolution which allowed more patients than ever to receive care remotely with more speed, convenience and access. Telehealth is now in the hand of a variety of users. It was important to make sure that the functionality was the main focus to make sure that users of different ages and experiences with technology can use it easily and efficiently. </p>

     <h4> You do not need to have all the answers:</h4>

    <p>A telehealth app is very intimidating to create because there is such a wide variety of features to include to encompass healthcare services. Although I have extensive experience from my background, through the project I was constantly wondering whether or not I included enough questions in my onboarding screening, or if the features are accessible to all types of users? However, it is okay to not know all the answers because testing your prototype will help narrow down any errors. The input from users will help guide decisions to make a more intuitive design. </p>

     <h4> Feedback and research from different perspectives:</h4>

    <p>I had several types of users give feedback on the prototype. This includes clinicians and public health advocates. I wanted to make sure the prototype was helpful, intuitive and up to par for the features that are included. A designer cannot create meaningful solutions without doing proper research for understanding the user and also for the field they are creating solutions for. I wanted to make sure that any features added to my app were useful and helped the user accomplish their goals.</p>
